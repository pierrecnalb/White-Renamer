## Why another batch renamer ?

Most free batch renamers look like this :

* They are clumsy and difficult to use.
* The options are too scattered in the window.
* The order in which the options are applied is unclear.

It is in the optic of making a powerful but still user-friendly software that White Renamer is born.
The interface simply contains boxes representing the structure of the files : FOLDER, FILE and EXTENSION. 
Each box contains actions to modify the desired file part. A possibility to add prefixes and suffixes is also available.


## Features
* Batch rename files, folders or both
* Change subfolders, subfiles recursively
* Change the case (uppercase, lowercase, titlecase)

* Remove or insert characters
* Add counter
* Append or prepend any of the above actions by using prefixes or suffixes
* Preview the changes automatically
* Undo changes
* Sort directories
* Cross-platform support
